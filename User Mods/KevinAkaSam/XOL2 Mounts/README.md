# XOL2 Mount for the Papilio

Pretty much self explaining. These are some slightly modified [Shera Mini](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder) mounts from/for the [XOL2](https://github.com/Armchair-Engineering/Xol-Toolhead) (they're raised by 4mm).

Since I'm using an older version of XOL2 I havent tested these exact files. So please do a test fit before disassembling anything and report back if this fits or if there are any issues.
