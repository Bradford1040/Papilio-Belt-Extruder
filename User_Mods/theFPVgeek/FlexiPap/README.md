I created another top cover for flexible filaments after attempting to use the available TPU-specific cover. Unfortunately, anything softer than 95A shore filament would still jam the filament. After some testing, I tightened the tolerances at the cover and the upper base. With these modified parts, I've been able to print as soft as both 85A Ninjtek NinjaFlex TPU and 75A NinjaTek Chinchilla TPE.
