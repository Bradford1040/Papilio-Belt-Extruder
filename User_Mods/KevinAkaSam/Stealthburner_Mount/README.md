# Voron Stealthburner Mount for the Papilio Lite

This is a modified CW2 mount to mount the Papilio Lite (The OG Pap does not fit!) on the [Voron Stealthburner](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner). It's modified from the [LGX Lite](https://github.com/Eytecz/LGX_Lite_Stealthburner_CW2_style_mount) SB Mount. Thank's a lot for the CAD!
