Add filament sensors to your Pap lite extruder! 

Two different configurations
- Single Sensor has a pre-extruder gear sensor
- Dual Sensor has the same sensor above the gears, but also one below the gears.

While the single sensor version has a bit of a [Doug Dimmadome](https://www.google.com/search?q=doug+dimmadome) vibe, the dual sensor is downright hideous looking. Looks aren't everything though, and these both work great! If you are running this with the Frank 2.0 toolhead, there is an [extruder mount](https://github.com/kevinakasam/FrankEnstein-Duct/tree/main/User%20Mods/adamstorm/Filament%20Sensor) that has a post-gear sensor so you can use the less-obnoxious single sensor version here. 

Both configurations come with either the standard or TPU top cover profile from the r3 pap lite release, and both profiles have versions of solid or cut faces. 

The top sensor is positioned at an angle to allow access to the 3rd mounting point of the pap lite extruder. This switch should be installed once the extruder is fastened in place due to the switch blocking the mounting point access hole. 

BOM:
- D2F microswitch (or similar), doesn't need to be super accurate - we're not setting z-position here
- 5.5mm ball bearing (example: https://a.co/d/6RdxncY or https://a.co/d/gXpXHlg)
- M2x8 self-tapping screws (2x)
- ECAS04 fitting (remove rubber stopper from the bottom, it's not needed)

Wiring is a little tight. I had to trim the legs of the bottom switch down to get it to fit well.
